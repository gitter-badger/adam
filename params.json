It also adds an advanced people directory. The whole addon is configurable by means of an XML, can be localized, supports Velocity templates and supports view and edit restrictions.\r\n\r\nStatus\r\n------\r\nThis addon is currently in beta phase and under heavy development. [Please help us to improve and report issues.](https://github.com/echocat/adam/issues)\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\nYou have several options:\r\n\r\n1. You can install it direct over the addon manager of confluence.\r\n2. You can download it from [Marketplace](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/org.echocat.adam) and install it manually.\r\n\r\nConfiguration\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n1. Go to ``<you base confluence url>/plugins/org.echocat.adam/administration.action``. Example ``http://wiki.foobar.com/plugins/org.echocat.adam/administration.action``\r\n2. Edit the configuration XML.\r\n\r\nSorry for now there is no documentation about the configuration XML and it could be changed because this is currently a beta. But you could refer the [Schema XSD](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/echocat/adam/master/src/main/resources/org/echocat/adam/schemas/configuration.xsd). The configuration will be validated against it before save.
